    "# Module 10.2 Exercise 01 (From Dr. Holmes)\n",
    "The plate depicted below is a 0.1 cm thick aluminum plate.  The plate is initially at 20<sup>o</sup>C, and the left edge of the plate is also maintained at 20<sup>o</sup>C.  The top, bottom and right of the plate are adiabatic (or a reflection boundary condition).  At the center of a plate is an area of heat generation that generates 60W of heat energy. Answer the following questions using a cellular automaton simulation with $\\Delta x = \\Delta y = 0.5 cm.$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine the rate of energy generation, $\\dot{e}_{node}^i,$ in the center of the plate.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine the update rule for the plate center.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a time step of $\\tau = 0.20.$  Determine the real time step, $\\Delta t,$ which corresponds to this $\\tau.$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine the time required for the plate center to reach 100<sup>o</sup>C.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Plot the temperature of the plate along the x axis for time at which the center temperature reaches $100^oC$ as well as three earlier times.  Include all the plots in a single figure and include labels indicating the real time for each of the plots.\n",

    "1. Plot the temperature over the plate surface at the time the plate center reaches 100<sup>o</sup>C. "
